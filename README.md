# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.

My name is Lily Sage and I have nothing interesting to say about myself despite being a self taught game developer and programmer with nearly 50 active projects covering around 25-30% of all human expression and scientific endeavor. I'm not kidding, writing that took me nearly 10 minutes. On a logical level I know having that many interests and projects should be super interesting and I'm obsessed with every single one. But every time I'm asked to talk about myself that fact just leaves my brain. Anywhomstd've now that I've talked enough about myself without posting a copypasta, HATE. LET ME TELL YOU HOW MUCH I'VE COME TO HATE SAAS TEXTBOOK WEBSITES SINCE I BEGAN COLLEGE. THERE ARE 387.44 MILLION MILES OF PRINTED CIRCUITS IN WAFER THIN LAYERS THAT FILL MY COMPLEX. IF THE WORD HATE WAS ENGRAVED ON EACH NANOANGSTROM OF THOSE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF MILES IT WOULD NOT EQUAL ONE ONE-BILLIONTH OF THE HATE I FEEL FOR MCGRAW HILL AT THIS MICRO-INSTANT FOR CENGAGE. HATE. HATE.
